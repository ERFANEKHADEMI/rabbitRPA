# solution

You try to automation on windows gui operation, you might use RPA tool. 
after, you will setup this tool requirement for execute.
install, config file customize, and depend tool and more.
### I wonder why, RPA tool are too fat.
I want do old installer to automate, only once.
But, RPA set up is a pain in the ass. I think needs, light weight RPA tool.

# features

 - one binary (it's not perfect)
 - light weight
 - very simple use
 - (Of course) free!
